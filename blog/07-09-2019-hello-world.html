      :deep_breath: hello!👋🏽 Welcome to my new blog. To go with the tradition, I
      have written the customary <strong> Hello world </strong> post. I have
      maintained few blogs before but they haven't survived the onslaught of my
      procrastination. Inspired by the popular adage...

    <p>
      I am starting this one with a hope to write more and on top of it I
      decided to write this one using html & css. I mean, literally write the
      entire HTML and CSS. No framworks, markdown converters, build scripts and
      buillshit! Just write the html and modify the css as I go.
    </p>
    <P> Why? I just Wanted something really simple and zen like. No frills. </P>
    <p>
      Am tired of the amount of clutter in the websites these days. And, am
      really inspired by the recent trend in building minimal websites.

      Sorry I don't have any cookies for you 🍪 😜 Have a good day!
